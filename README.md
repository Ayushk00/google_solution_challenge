# Urban Livability Prediction Project

## Overview

Creating a model that predicts the livability of a city based on environmental changes, including land use, deforestation, urban expansion, and pollution indices. This project leverages real-time satellite data and machine learning techniques to provide valuable insights for urban planning and public awareness.

## Project Outline

### 1. Data Collection

- Obtain real-time satellite data from publicly available sources (e.g., Landsat, Copernicus).
- Access pollution indices and air quality data from relevant sources (ground-based monitoring stations, environmental agencies).

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Preprocess satellite imagery, including cloud removal, normalization, and segmentation.
- Integrate pollution indices with corresponding spatial and temporal information.

### 3. Change Detection

- Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., CNNs) for change detection in satellite images.
- Train the model on pairs of images from different time periods with labeled information on changes (deforestation, urban expansion, etc.).

### 4. Feature Extraction

- Extract relevant features from satellite imagery and pollution indices indicative of environmental changes and air quality.
- Features include vegetation indices, built-up area percentages, pollutant concentrations, etc.

### 5. Data Analysis

- Analyze the relationship between environmental changes, pollution levels, and perceived livability.
- Use statistical methods to identify significant patterns and correlations in the data.

### 6. Livability Index Prediction

- Build a predictive model (e.g., regression model or machine learning model) to estimate a livability index for a city.
- Consider factors such as green spaces, air quality, and land use patterns in the model.

### 7. Validation and Testing

- Validate the model using a separate set of data not used during training.
- Test the model's performance against historical data to assess its accuracy in predicting past livability.

### 8. Visualization

- Develop a user-friendly interface or a dashboard for visualizing predicted livability indices for different cities.
- Include maps, charts, and other visual elements to make the information accessible to the general public and government officials.

### 9. Future Prospects Prediction

- Use the trained model to predict future environmental changes and livability indices based on ongoing trends.
- Provide insights into potential challenges and areas that require attention for sustainable development.

### 10. Implementation

- Implement the model as a web or mobile application accessible to the public.
- Consider collaboration with local governments for more informed urban planning decisions.

### 11. Ethical Considerations

- Address ethical considerations, including data privacy, bias in the model, and transparency in predictions.
